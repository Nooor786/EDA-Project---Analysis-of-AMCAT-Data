Overview
This project involves an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of AMCAT data, focusing on identifying the factors that influence salary levels for job seekers. Using a dataset of job applicants from various educational and professional backgrounds, we aim to explore key salary drivers such as education, specialization, demographics, and geographic location. In addition, we attempt to build a predictive model that estimates salary ranges based on these factors.

Background
This project was conducted to gain insights into how various attributes of job seekers affect their salary expectations. AMCAT provides a valuable dataset, allowing us to delve deeper into trends in employability and salary distribution across different demographics, qualifications, and geographic regions.

Problem Statement
The main goal of this project is to analyze and forecast salary ranges for job seekers based on attributes such as educational qualifications, job titles, gender, and geographic location. The key questions we aim to address include:

What factors are most influential in determining salary levels?
Is there a correlation between educational background, specialization, and salary?
How do demographic factors like gender and location influence salary expectations?
Project Objectives
The objectives of this project include:

Performing an in-depth exploratory data analysis of AMCAT data to understand key patterns and trends.
Identifying the main factors that influence salary levels for job seekers.
Building and evaluating a predictive model for salary estimation based on attributes like education, experience, and location.
Providing actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.
Data Description
The dataset consists of 3998 job candidates and includes 39 features related to personal demographics, educational background, AMCAT scores, and salary information. Key attributes include:

Numerical Features: Salary, GPA, test scores, etc.
Categorical Features: Gender, degree specialization, job city, etc.
Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing irrelevant features, and addressing data inconsistencies.
Data Transformation: Encoding categorical variables for analysis and modeling.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate and Bivariate Analysis: Understanding the distribution of key variables and exploring relationships between features such as salary and education.
Visualization: Plotting histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize trends and correlations.
3. Model Building
Predictive Model: Developing a salary prediction model using algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Key Findings
Influence of Education:
Degrees in technical fields (e.g., B.Tech, M.Tech) lead to higher salary expectations, especially in Computer Science and Technology domains.
Geographical Impact:
Certain cities offer higher average salaries, making location a critical factor in job seekersâ€™ salary expectations.
Gender Disparities:
Salary gaps between male and female candidates persist, with males generally earning higher salaries across different roles.
Role-Based Salary Trends:
Job titles like "Junior Manager" are associated with higher average salaries compared to other roles.
Technologies Used
Python: For data analysis and model building.
Pandas: For data manipulation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and analysis.
